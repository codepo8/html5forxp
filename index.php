<p class="intro">This is a call to arms to make Windows XP users move away from Internet Explorer to help us all make the web a richer and more enjoyable place.</p>  
  
<p>The internet already is a wonderful place. A media for all and a place to find everything you need. We need to care for it, advance it as a media and use it to its full potential much like we do with the other media we have.</p>

<p>Over the years, the internet and our use of it has grown. We want more than just some texts with pretty images and forms to fill in and to send off. To make the web easy to use for everybody, we need to upgrade the infrastructure of the web and the software we use to consume it.</p>

<p>Much like you need to have a straight and even road to drive fast with your car and use the least petrol, you need modern browsers to get the best out of the web of today.</p>

<p>Microsoft <a href="http://www.beautyoftheweb.com/">promote a beautiful web</a> with the release of Internet Explorer 9 and urge people to expect more of their day-to-day web experience but as IE9 is only available for Windows Vista and Windows 7 users, those who use Windows XP (as it is good enough for them) can not get a beautiful web.</p>

<p>Windows XP users can only upgrade to IE8 as a replacement for the woefully outdated IE6, which - even according to Microsoft - <a href="http://ie6countdown.com/">needs to go away</a>.</p>

<p><strong>This is not fair and this is not helping the web.</strong></p> 

<p>Windows XP users should turn their back on Internet Explorer and choose a better browser.</p>

<h2>An option to fix your current browser?</h2>

<p>If you can not install a different browser on your system - take a look at <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/">Google's Chrome Frame</a> to at least patch it.</p>


<h2>What we can do with better browsers</h2>

<p>HTML5 and related technologies are the <strong>evolution of the web as we know it</strong>. Instead of using lots of meaningless code to simulate what browsers should do for us, we have new elements and powerful systems to use to make the web a more interesting and easier to use place. Just think of the things we can already do:</p>

<ul><li>Native video and audio with keyboard enabled controls and the option to be manipulated in any way necessary.</li><li>Forms with richer controls like colour pickers, calendars and autocomplete fields.</li><li>Rounded corners, gradients and drop shadows without the need for any graphics</li><li>Local and offline storage to create real application experiences</li><li>Using geographical location and device orientation to give you a personalised experience of the web</li><li>Allowing for rich graphs and visualisations using Canvas and SVG.</li><li>Creating games that don't ask you to install plugins.</li><li>3D graphics and support for any font</li><li>Drag and drop and touch support for tablets.</li><li>File upload and access to the file system like any other application.</li></ul>

<p>All this can be yours - just move on from Internet Explorer if you stick with XP.</p>
